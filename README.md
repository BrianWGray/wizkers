Wizkers
============

Wizkers is a universal open source application for both data visualization and control of various kinds of scientific instruments. It is a full Javascript/HTML5 application which runs on nearly any computer, phone or tablet.

It can also run as a standalone server application, on any Linux platform, from a simple Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone black, all the way to cloud-hosted AWS instances, which gives it tremendous flexibility. Basically, it is a real open source simple 'cloud' system and one of the only 'cloud' projects out there with a fully open source license for both front-end and backend.

Out of the box, Wizkers supports a variety of instruments, and it can easily be extended to support additional devices.

You will find all the information you need on www.wizkers.io, including a complete user and developer documentation.
